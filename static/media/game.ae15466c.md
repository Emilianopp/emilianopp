I've always been fond of videogames and wanted to experiment creating a clone of Space Invaders.

As a Christmas gift to my sister I designed this ameteour game with the use of images and items we are fond of. 

The game follow basic controls using right and left arrow keys to manouver and spacebar to shoot projectile.
